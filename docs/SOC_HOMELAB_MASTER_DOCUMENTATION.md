## 1. Project overview & purpose

**SOC Homelab** (originally "Fortress Bazzite") is Joost Hebly's private cybersecurity training environment — a real SOC, built and operated end-to-end, including the real problems that come with it.

Focus areas: **Blue Team** (Security Onion/Kibana monitoring, incident response, detection engineering), **Red Team** (vulnerability testing, exploitation, AD attacks), realistic **Active Directory**, general **network defense**. Also a portfolio piece — Joost produces formal reports/documentation from it alongside the working lab.

**Origin:** started as Fortress Bazzite (self-built Suricata+Zeek+Wazuh stack, design doc 2026-07-05). In practice, **Security Onion** was chosen instead — same goal, one bundled platform (it already includes Suricata, Zeek, and Fleet/Elastic Agent in place of Wazuh). Original detection goals carried forward — [§6](#6-detection-use-cases--incident-response).

**AI collaboration:** ChatGPT for architecture/planning/strategy, Claude Code for terminal work/documentation/scripts/implementation. Both operate under the AI rules in [§4](#4-architecture-security--ai-rules). **Golden rule:** no destructive changes without approval; all changes documented.

                     receives mirrored traffic from all
                     pentest-lab VMs via soc-mirror.service
```

Security Onion has two NICs: `pentest-lab` (.30, Fleet/Kibana/SSH/web) and `monitor-net` (no IP, mirrored traffic only).

### IP address table

| IP | System | virsh VM name | SSH alias | SSH user | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 192.168.50.1 | OPNsense (firewall/gateway) | `OPNsense-FW` | `opnsense` | `root` | ✅ |
| 192.168.50.10 | DC01 (AD, PDC Emulator, domain `pentest.lab`) | `DC01` | `dc01` | `Administrator` | ✅ |
| 192.168.50.20 | WIN11-01 (domain-joined as `DESKTOP-EFKB8GQ`) | `WIN11-01` | `win11-01` | `pentest\administrator` (key auth confirmed working) | ✅ |
| 192.168.50.30 | Security Onion 3.1.0 (SIEM/IDS/Fleet) | `SOC-SecurityOnion` | `security-onion` | `socadmin` | ✅ |
| 192.168.50.40 | ubuntu-server-01 (live OWASP Juice Shop on :3000) | `ubuntu-server-01` | `ubuntu-server` | `sysadmin` (key auth confirmed working) | ✅ |
| 192.168.50.50 | Kali Linux (Red Team) | ` ATTACK-Kali` ⚠️ *leading space in the name* | `kali` | `blue1` | ✅ |
| 192.168.50.70 | Metasploitable2 (vulnerable target) | `Target-Metasploitable2` | *(none)* | — | ✅ |

**Known naming bug:** the VM name ` ATTACK-Kali` has a literal leading space in libvirt (broke name-matching scripts once — [§7](#7-troubleshooting-history)). New scripts should match on UUID instead.

**IP authority:** `docs/ASSET_INVENTORY.md` and `NETWORK.md` (2026-07-13) are authoritative — older docs and the 2026-07-09 daily report contain now-superseded IPs for Security Onion, Kali, ubuntu-server-01, and Metasploitable2; not repeated here.

### Virtual networks (libvirt)

| Network | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `pentest-lab` | Main network, 192.168.50.0/24, isolated. No libvirt-native DHCP — OPNsense handles this exclusively. |
| `monitor-net` | Isolated, no IP addressing, exclusively for traffic mirroring to Security Onion. |
| `default` | Standard libvirt network, not used by lab VMs. |

### Physical host

**Bazzite Linux.** CPU: Intel Core i9-11900K (8c/1s) · GPU: NVIDIA RTX 3090 · RAM: 62 GiB · WiFi: Intel AX210 (Wi-Fi 6E) · Virtualization: KVM/QEMU/libvirt/virt-manager. All ✅ live-verified. ⚠️ WiFi PCI-passthrough to Kali and host-level Docker not reconfirmed — Juice Shop's actual location is `ubuntu-server-01`, not the host.

### Traffic mirroring (`soc-mirror.service`)

Event-driven (`scripts/soc-mirror.sh`, triggered by a libvirt qemu hook on every VM start/stop) — no polling timer. When a `pentest-lab` VM starts, its traffic mirrors to Security Onion's `monitor-net` interface; stale rules clean up automatically on Security Onion restart. Status: `scripts/soc-mirror.sh --status`.

### DNS and DHCP

**DHCP:** Kea DHCPv4 on OPNsense, LAN interface only. Subnet `192.168.50.0/24`, dynamic pool `.100`–`.200`, 7 static reservations (one per lab VM by MAC — the canonical IP plan, see [§9](#9-asset-inventory)). Option 6 pushes `192.168.50.10` (DC01) as DNS server. Kea DHCPv6 exists but has no interface assigned (inactive). **DNS:** DC01 (AD DNS) authoritative for `pentest.lab`; OPNsense's Unbound forwards the `pentest.lab` domain specifically to `192.168.50.10` and has one host override (`dc01.pentest.lab` → `.10`), everything else resolved/forwarded normally. Confirmed 2026-07-13 via a full read-only OPNsense audit — full detail: `docs/OPNSENSE_AUDIT_2026-07-13.md`.

### Security principles

Segmentation (`monitor-net` fully separate from `pentest-lab`) · least privilege (Security Onion hostgroups) · monitor first, block second · every change documented.

### Planned network improvements (not yet built)

VLAN segmentation · separate management/attack networks · additional Windows clients · honeypots · more SOC sensors.

## 3. Systems in detail

_All facts below are live-verified 2026-07-13 unless marked otherwise._

### 3.1 Bazzite host & virtualization

Physical KVM/QEMU/libvirt/virt-manager host, doubling as Joost's daily desktop. Storage: qcow2 (snapshots, thin provisioning). Basic lifecycle:
```
virsh list --all
virsh start VMNAME
virsh shutdown VMNAME       # graceful; --destroy only if stuck
```
⚠️ QEMU guest agent isn't configured by default per VM — install/enable in-guest before relying on guest-management features.

**Own Elastic Agent (2026-07-14):** the host itself (IP `192.168.50.254` on the `virbr10`/`pentest-lab` bridge — distinct from OPNsense's `.1`) runs a log/metrics-only Elastic Agent (journald `system.auth`/`system.syslog` + system/metrics, no Elastic Defend by design — this is the machine every VM depends on). Confirmed Healthy/Connected in Fleet, confirmed to survive a full host reboot with zero manual steps. Ingest-side verified end-to-end the same day: a deliberate packet capture (zero TCP resets) plus a targeted Elasticsearch/Hunt query for the exact test window confirmed all 3 test `sudo` events fully indexed with correct field-level detail. An earlier same-day finding that journald logs never arrived was itself wrong — a diagnostic-method problem (the Fleet data-streams API doesn't reliably surface this bursty dataset), not a real delivery failure. Full investigation and methodology notes: `docs/troubleshooting/08_bazzite_host_elastic_agent.md`. Quick health check across this host + all 7 lab VMs: `scripts/soc-health-check.sh`.

### 3.2 OPNsense (firewall/gateway)

Central firewall/gateway for 192.168.50.0/24 — firewall, routing, DHCP, DNS forwarding. IP `.1`. SSH alias `opnsense`, user `root`, password-only login by design (no key auth configured — confirmed via the OPNsense audit, not a regression). OPNsense 26.1.11_6-amd64 / FreeBSD 14.3. No custom firewall rules beyond the LAN/WAN defaults (no inter-VM segmentation at this layer), no VPN configured, single local admin user. Full configuration audit: `docs/OPNSENSE_AUDIT_2026-07-13.md`.

### 3.3 DC01 — Active Directory Domain Controller

Windows Server 2022 Standard Evaluation. Domain `pentest.lab`, DC01 is PDC Emulator (only DC). IP `.10`. SSH alias `dc01`/`Administrator`. Timezone `W. Europe Standard Time` (cosmetic; UTC clock is authoritative).

**AD structure is built** (not just planned):

```
DC=pentest,DC=lab
├── OU=Domain Controllers   (DC01)
├── OU=Admins               (IT Admin 01)
├── OU=AD-Users             (soctest, Helpdesk 01, Employee 01, Manager 01, HR 01, Finance 01)
├── OU=Workstations         (empty)
├── OU=Servers              (empty)
├── OU=Groups               (SOC-Analysts: soctest · Helpdesk: no members)
└── OU=Service-Accounts     (SQL Service)
```

⚠️ **Known gaps** (real, deliberately left as-is pending [§12](#12-attack-scope-agreed-red-team-test-plan)): `OU=Workstations`/`OU=Servers` empty (WIN11-01 not moved in); `IT Admin 01` has no elevated group membership despite its name/OU; `Helpdesk` group has no members; role accounts (Employee/Manager/HR/Finance 01) are undifferentiated `Domain Users`.

**Monitoring:** Elastic Agent + Sysmon 15.21 (SwiftOnSecurity config) enrolled in Fleet, **Healthy** — full root-cause history in [§7.6](#76-dc01-fleet-health--sysmon-telemetry-2026-07-13). NTP via `pool.ntp.org`; `vmictimesync` disabled (was fighting NTP at boot).

### 3.4 WIN11-01 — Windows 11 workstation

IP `.20`, SSH alias `win11-01` (`pentest\administrator`, key auth confirmed working — see `docs/troubleshooting/09_win11-01_ssh_access.md`). Domain-joined as `DESKTOP-EFKB8GQ` (never renamed, still in default `Computers` container). As of 2026-07-13, only TCP 135 was reachable; SMB/RDP/WinRM/139 were blocked by Windows Firewall. As of 2026-07-14, port 22 (SSH) is also open — Joost enabled OpenSSH Server himself via the VM console, a deliberate change, not a regression. Other ports not re-verified this session, assumed unchanged. ⚠️ Intended training purpose still undecided beyond "becomes a target after cleanup" — [§12](#12-attack-scope-agreed-red-team-test-plan).

**Monitoring (2026-07-14):** Elastic Agent 9.3.3 + Sysmon 15.21 (SwiftOnSecurity config) enrolled in Fleet under the same `endpoints-initial` policy DC01 uses (Windows Event Logs, Sysmon, Elastic Defend, osquery, metrics). **Healthy** — reached that state after Fleet's server-side view lagged the agent's own local status for ~12 minutes post-enrollment, comparable to DC01's documented stabilization delay, not a stuck state. Confirmed in Hunt: ~6,351 total events, ~1,004 `windows.sysmon_operational` events, current activity. Full investigation, including a firewall hostgroup step that was tested and found to be a no-op (not the fix) and a `wsasend` connection-reset message shown to also occur on DC01's healthy agent (so not diagnostic of a fault): `docs/troubleshooting/10_win11-01_sysmon_elastic_agent.md`.

### 3.5 ubuntu-server-01 — Linux server, active Red Team target

IP `.40` — confirmed via OPNsense's own Kea DHCP reservation database. Previously seen drifting to `.100` (dynamic pool) after a reboot; **root cause proven and fixed 2026-07-14** (`docs/troubleshooting/12_ubuntu-server-01_dhcp_reservation_fix.md`) — this Ubuntu image runs two DHCP negotiations per boot (an early dracut-fallback one, then the real netplan one), and without `dhcp-identifier: mac` the second used a non-MAC client identifier that Kea's reservation didn't match. Fixed with one netplan line; validated across a full reboot. SSH alias `ubuntu-server`/`sysadmin` (not `ubuntu` as earlier documented); key auth confirmed working. Elastic Agent installed and Healthy in Fleet (log/metrics-only, same scope as the Bazzite host) — `docs/troubleshooting/11_ubuntu-server-01_elastic_agent_rollout.md`. Runs **OWASP Juice Shop live** on port 3000 (HTTP-confirmed, not a leftover — it's up right now).

### 3.6 Security Onion — SOC platform

Security Onion 3.1.0 standalone. IP `.30`, SSH `security-onion`/`socadmin` (key auth works). OS timezone intentionally UTC (web UI already renders local time). Own internal firewall — hostgroups gate portgroups, membership in one grants nothing in another (root cause of the DC01 outage, [§7.6](#76-dc01-fleet-health--sysmon-telemetry-2026-07-13); reference: [§5.4](#54-network-ports--firewall-hostgroups-reference)). Bundles Suricata, Zeek, Elasticsearch, Kibana, Fleet, Hunt.

### 3.7 Kali Linux — Red Team workstation

VM ` ATTACK-Kali` (leading space). IP `.50`, SSH `kali`/`blue1` (key auth works). Vulnerability scanning, exploitation, network analysis — authorized use inside this isolated lab only.

### 3.8 Metasploitable2 — vulnerable training target

VM `Target-Metasploitable2`. IP `.70`. Stock, unmodified port fingerprint confirmed (FTP/SSH/Telnet/SMTP/DNS/HTTP/rpcbind/SMB/rexec-rlogin-rsh/Java-RMI/ingreslock/NFS/ProFTPd-backdoor/MySQL/distccd/PostgreSQL/VNC/X11/UnrealIRCd/AJP/Tomcat). No ACPI shutdown support — `lab-stop.sh` force-stops it after 60s (expected).

## 4. Architecture, security & AI rules

### Why these technologies were chosen

| Decision | Choice | Core reason |
|---|---|---|
| Host OS | Bazzite Linux | Modern Linux + NVIDIA + gaming + virtualization on one machine |
| Virtualization | KVM/QEMU/libvirt/virt-manager | Native Linux, full control, deeper understanding than a turnkey hypervisor |
| Firewall | OPNsense | Realistic enterprise firewall/routing/DHCP/DNS practice |
| SOC platform | Security Onion | Complete SIEM+IDS+NSM bundle, superseding a hand-rolled stack |
| Identity | Windows Server AD (DC01) | Realistic detection/attack scenarios (logins, privilege escalation, lateral movement) |
| Version control | Git | History, recovery points, professional change tracking |
| Secrets storage | Separate `Secure/SOC-Secure.img`, never in Git | Docs can be shared; secrets must never enter Git history |
| AI assistance | ChatGPT (planning) + Claude Code (implementation) | Support tools, not decision-makers — bound by the rules below |

### AI rules (binding on any AI assistant working on this project)

Merged from `AI_ACCESS_POLICY.md`, `PROJECT_RULES.md`, `CLAUDE.md`. Claude Code acts as **a junior SOC engineer and documentation assistant**, not an autonomous administrator — documentation is treated as more reliable than its own memory; source of truth: `README.md`, `PROJECT_RULES.md`, `AI_ACCESS_POLICY.md`, `docs/INDEX.md`, `docs/guides/`, `docs/troubleshooting/`, `docs/decisions/`.

**Allowed:** read/analyze documentation and configs, explain commands, suggest improvements, write/maintain documentation, troubleshoot (research, diagnosis, proposing fixes). AI assists — it doesn't replace administrator decisions.

**Never:** store or write down passwords/secrets/API keys/private keys/tokens anywhere; commit credentials; modify firewall rules or critical infrastructure without approval; delete or destructively change anything without confirmation; ignore previous documented decisions.

**Credentials:** never in Git or markdown, not even temporarily. Live only in `Secure/SOC-Secure.img`, opened manually by the administrator — an assistant never touches it. The user enters passwords themselves when needed.

**Infrastructure change procedure:** explain what will change → explain risk/impact → snapshot/backup → get explicit confirmation → execute the smallest sufficient change → document the result.

**Troubleshooting method:** check existing docs → identify the affected system → review prior troubleshooting cases → explain root cause → apply the smallest safe fix → update documentation.

**General behavior:** respect prior decisions, preserve existing architecture, ask before destructive (even reversible) actions, document discoveries as they happen, prefer safe/reversible solutions, explain commands and verify results rather than assuming success.

**Read-only investigation is in-scope without prior confirmation** — e.g. using `virsh`, ARP tables, unauthenticated port probes, or already-working passwordless SSH to verify facts for documentation. Anything that *changes* the lab (firewall, AD objects, service state) still needs the full change procedure above.

**Final principle:** documented, reproducible, secure, understandable — documentation first, automation second, security always.

### Core security principles

Least privilege · defense in depth (OPNsense + Security Onion hostgroups + host controls) · network isolation (192.168.50.0/24 is isolated because it hosts attack tooling and deliberately vulnerable machines) · documentation before/with automation · backups before changes · monitoring as the foundation, not an add-on · all offensive testing stays inside the lab boundary.

### Incident response phases

Identification → Analysis → Containment → Recovery → Lessons learned. Operationalized in the runbook — [§6.2](#62-incident-response-runbook).

---

## 5. Operational guides

### 5.1 Starting/stopping the lab

Preferred: **Pentest Lab Start / Stop** desktop launchers (all 7 VMs, correct order). Command line:
```bash
~/Homelab/scripts/lab-start.sh
~/Homelab/scripts/lab-stop.sh
```
Single VM: `virsh -c qemu:///system start|shutdown <vm-name>` — note the leading space in ` ATTACK-Kali` ([§9](#9-asset-inventory)). `lab-start.sh` is idempotent; `lab-stop.sh` tries graceful ACPI shutdown first (60s/180s timeout) before force-killing.

### 5.2 Connecting to systems

**SSH Alle Machines** launcher opens one Konsole tab per machine, or directly:
```bash
ssh opnsense
ssh dc01
ssh security-onion
ssh kali
ssh ubuntu-server
ssh win11-01
```
**Homelab VM Manager** opens virt-manager on `qemu:///system`. **Key status:** `kali`, `security-onion`, `dc01`, `ubuntu-server`, and `win11-01` are all passwordless; only `opnsense` still prompts (password-only by design, not a regression — see [§9](#9-asset-inventory)).

### 5.3 Security Onion / Kibana / Fleet in the browser

**Security Onion Operator** launcher opens a persistent Playwright/Chromium profile with every key page as a tab (Overview, Hunt, Detections, Cases, Grid, Kibana, Fleet), driven via a local CDP port (never exposed beyond localhost). First run waits for manual login to both Security Onion and Kibana/Fleet (two separate logins); session persists in `browser/profile/` (never in Git). Everything built so far is **read-only** — nothing can modify Fleet, detection rules, or Security Onion config.

Fleet status report: `~/Homelab/scripts/soc-web-audit.sh` → Markdown report in `browser/artifacts/`.

⚠️ **Recorded incident:** a script once printed a live session cookie into terminal output via a raw `context.request` call. No external leak, but fixed immediately (daemon restarted, session invalidated) and all API calls now route through `fetchJsonInPage()`, which runs inside the authenticated page so cookies never pass through this project's own code. Don't reintroduce raw out-of-page HTTP calls without the same care.

### 5.4 Network ports & firewall hostgroups reference

Security Onion's **own** firewall (separate from OPNsense) — reconstructed from `/opt/so/saltstack/default/salt/firewall/{defaults,soc_firewall}.yaml`.

| Portgroup | Port(s) | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `elastic_agent_control` | 8220 | Fleet Server checkin |
| `elastic_agent_data` | 5055 | Data ingest |
| `elastic_agent_update` | 8443 | Agent updates |
| `endgame` | 3765 | Elastic Defend/Endpoint output |
| `beats_5044`/`5644`(SSL)/`5066`/`5056` | — | Logstash beats input |
| `kibana` | 5601 | Kibana web UI |
| `elasticsearch_rest` | 9200 | Elasticsearch REST |

**Key hostgroups:** `analyst` (web UI/Kibana users) · `elastic_agent_endpoint` (Fleet checkin) · `beats_endpoint`/`_ssl` (log shipping) · `endgame` (Elastic Defend) · `manager`/`receiver`/`sensor`/`standalone` (grid roles) · `desktop` (admin workstations, like `analyst` plus extras).

**A normal endpoint with Elastic Agent needs *all three* of `elastic_agent_endpoint`, `beats_endpoint`, and `endgame`** — `analyst` alone is not enough; one hostgroup grants nothing in another.

```bash
sudo so-firewall includehost <hostgroup> <ip>
sudo so-firewall apply           # additive; so-firewall removehost <ip> to strip entirely
```
Read-only inspection: `cat /opt/so/log/so-firewall.log`, `ss -tlnp`. From another host: `Test-NetConnection -ComputerName 192.168.50.30 -Port 8220`.

### 5.5 Desktop launchers

| Launcher | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Pentest Lab Start / Stop | Start/stop all 7 VMs in order, via Konsole (`--hold`) |
| SSH Alle Machines | One Konsole window, independent tab per machine |
| Homelab VM Manager | virt-manager on `qemu:///system` |
| Security Onion Operator | Persistent browser session — [§5.3](#53-security-onion--kibana--fleet-in-the-browser) |

Bazzite has no `gnome-terminal` — all terminal launchers use Konsole specifically.

**SSH config** (`~/.ssh/config`):

| Alias | Host | User | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `opnsense` | .1 | root | Password-only, currently not even password-prompting reliably |
| `dc01` | .10 | Administrator | Key auth works |
| `security-onion` | .30 | socadmin | Key auth works |
| `kali` | .50 | blue1 | Key auth works |
| `ubuntu-server` | .40 | sysadmin | Key auth confirmed working (2026-07-14) |
| `win11-01` | .20 | `pentest\administrator` | Added 2026-07-14, key auth confirmed working (see `docs/troubleshooting/09_win11-01_ssh_access.md`) |

### 5.6 Quick reference

```bash
# Sysmon test event on DC01, then check Hunt (Last 15 Minutes):
# host.name:"dc01" AND event.dataset:"windows.sysmon_operational"
Start-Process -FilePath 'cmd.exe' -ArgumentList '/c echo test' -Wait

~/Homelab/scripts/soc-mirror.sh --status              # mirroring status
ssh security-onion "tail -20 /opt/so/log/so-firewall.log"
```

## 6. Detection use cases & incident response

### 6.1 What this SOC should detect

✅ present (works once traffic/logs arrive) · ⚠️ should work via default rulesets, not yet deliberately confirmed · ❌ needs custom rules, not built.

| Detection | Status |
|---|---|
| ICMP ping sweeps / TCP scans (SYN/FIN/NULL/XMAS) / UDP scans | ✅ Confirmed 2026-07-15 — see Metasploitable2 Tier 1 scan below |
| OS fingerprinting / banner grabbing | ✅ Confirmed 2026-07-15 — see Metasploitable2 Tier 1 scan below |
| SSH / FTP / SMB brute force | ⚠️ (SMB relevant especially toward DC01) |
| Suspicious DNS requests | ⚠️ (Zeek `dns.log`; Sysmon event 22 on DC01) |
| Known exploit signatures / reverse shells / Metasploit indicators | ⚠️ (Suricata rulesets; Sysmon process-creation for host-side) |
| SQLi / command injection / directory traversal | ⚠️ (Suricata web-attack rulesets) |

**Metasploitable2 Tier 1 scan — TCP scans + OS fingerprinting/banner grabbing, confirmed 2026-07-15:**

- **Command:** `nmap -sV -sC -p- 192.168.50.70` (full 65535 TCP ports, service/version detection, default NSE scripts).
- **Source:** ATTACK-Kali (`192.168.50.50`, run via SSH from the Bazzite host). **Target:** Metasploitable2 (`192.168.50.70`).
- **Time window:** `2026-07-15 01:50:48Z` – `01:53:20Z` (scan itself: `01:50:54Z`–`01:53:10Z`, 136.31s per nmap's own summary).
- **Result:** 30 open ports found (vsftpd 2.3.4 with anonymous login, telnet, Postfix smtpd, BIND 9.4.2, Apache 2.2.8, unauthenticated NFS/RPC, Samba 3.0.20, rexecd, a literal "Metasploitable root shell" bindshell on 1524, MySQL 5.0.51a, distccd, PostgreSQL 8.3, VNC, UnrealIRCd, Tomcat, Ruby DRb) — matches this target's known stock fingerprint.
- **Hunt evidence, same source/dest/window:**
  - `event.dataset:"zeek.conn"` / `zeek.weird`: **65,801 events** — confirms full network-level visibility of the scan traffic (query: `source.ip:"192.168.50.50" AND destination.ip:"192.168.50.70" AND @timestamp:[2026-07-15T01:50:40.000Z TO 2026-07-15T01:53:20.000Z]`).
  - `event.module:"suricata"`, same source/dest/window: **172 real alerts**, not raw traffic — signature-based detections firing on the actual scan. Distinct signatures observed: `ET SCAN Potential SSH Scan OUTBOUND` (medium), `ET SCAN Suspicious inbound to PostgreSQL port 5432` (medium), `ET SCAN Suspicious inbound to mySQL port 3306` (medium), `GPL DNS named version attempt` (medium — fired by `-sC`'s `dns-nsid` script, a direct banner-grab signature), `GPL NETBIOS SMB-DS IPC$ share access` (low — fired by the SMB/`smb-os-discovery` enumeration scripts).
- **Why this flips both rows:** `ET SCAN Potential SSH Scan OUTBOUND` and the PostgreSQL/MySQL "suspicious inbound" signatures are pattern-based scan detections that fired directly on this `-p-` full-port sweep — confirms **TCP scan detection** works, not just default-ruleset assumption. `GPL DNS named version attempt` and the SMB share-access/`smb-os-discovery` signature are specifically banner-grab/service-fingerprinting detections, triggered by nmap's own `-sC` scripts querying BIND's version and enumerating SMB — confirms **OS fingerprinting/banner grabbing detection** works, not just passive Zeek visibility as previously assumed.

**Host-based (Sysmon on DC01):** Process Create (1), Network Connection (3), File Create (11), DNS Query (22) — all ✅ confirmed with test events. Other event types (registry, image load) — ⚠️ covered by config, not individually tested. Elastic Defend also produces its own detections since the 2026-07-13 firewall fix.

**How to test (Purple Team style):** run a harmless version of the technique from Kali, check Security Onion Hunt/Detections. Example:
```bash
for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do ssh -o ConnectTimeout=3 -o BatchMode=yes nope@192.168.50.40; done
# Hunt: destination.ip:"192.168.50.40" AND event.dataset:*ssh*
```

### 6.2 Incident response runbook

Fixed procedure for any alert — real, test, or exercise:

1. **Confirm** — Security Onion Alerts/Detections: which rule, source/destination, when (SO shows local time, +02:00 summer), how often.
2. **Context** — Hunt: `source.ip:"<IP>" OR destination.ip:"<IP>"`. Known lab system ([§9](#9-asset-inventory))? Deliberate test running (`docs/daily/`)? Anything else at that time?
3. **Host check** (if SSH-reachable) — logs/processes, Sysmon events around the timestamp. Investigating is always fine independently; changing/restarting/isolating needs a quick explanation first unless already agreed.
4. **Record** — write up in `docs/daily/YYYY-MM-DD/rapport.md` regardless of outcome; genuine new technical problems also get a `docs/troubleshooting/` doc.
5. **If real** — don't panic (lab is isolated); consider isolating via `virsh` (explain first); preserve evidence before cleanup; document as step 4.

**Quick Hunt queries:** `host.name:"<lowercase-name>"` · `... AND event.module:"windows"` · `... AND event.dataset:"windows.sysmon_operational"` · `source.ip:"<ip>" OR destination.ip:"<ip>"`. ⚠️ Hostnames index lowercase (`dc01`), even though Fleet displays capitalized.

### 6.3 Detection validation plan

**In progress — [§12](#12-attack-scope-agreed-red-team-test-plan) test session started 2026-07-15 (Phase 3 of the project roadmap).** Every ⚠️ in [§6.1](#61-what-this-soc-should-detect) gets tested here rather than in a separate pass: Tier 1 (recon) covers scans/sweeps/fingerprinting/DNS; Tier 2 (Metasploitable2/Juice Shop exploitation) covers brute force, exploit signatures, reverse shells, Meterpreter, SQLi/injection; Sysmon "other" event IDs get tested on DC01 or WIN11-01 once it's a target. Method: run technique → check Hunt → flip ⚠️ to ✅/❌ with the query and evidence used. Also planned: one full runbook dry-run (§6.2) against a real alert from that pass, logged in `docs/daily/`.

**Tier 1 progress:**

| Scenario | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Full port/service scan — Metasploitable2 | ✅ Done, 2026-07-15 | See [§6.1](#61-what-this-soc-should-detect) "Metasploitable2 Tier 1 scan" — 172 Suricata alerts, 65,801 Zeek events, flipped 2 rows to ✅ |
| Web app recon — Juice Shop (`nikto`, `gobuster`/`ffuf`) | ✅ Done, 2026-07-15 | See "Juice Shop Tier 1 web recon" below — 3,637 Suricata alerts, no §6.1 row flipped outright (see notes) |
| AD/domain enumeration — DC01 (`enum4linux-ng`, `netexec smb`, anonymous LDAP) | ⏳ Planned, read-only only | — |
| Network sweep (`.0/24`) | ✅ Already done (`nmap -sn`, confirmed known IPs only, per [§12](#12-attack-scope-agreed-red-team-test-plan) "Preparation already done") | — |

**Juice Shop Tier 1 web recon — confirmed 2026-07-15:**

- **Commands:** `nikto -h http://192.168.50.40:3000` (8,907 requests, 95s, 25 items reported), then `gobuster dir -u http://192.168.50.40:3000 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt --exclude-length 9903` (the Juice Shop SPA returns HTTP 200 for any unmatched path — length-excluded to filter that wildcard).
- **Source:** ATTACK-Kali (`192.168.50.50`). **Target:** ubuntu-server-01 / Juice Shop (`192.168.50.40:3000`).
- **Time window:** `2026-07-15 01:58:31Z`–`02:01:09Z` (nikto `01:58:34`–`02:00:09Z`; gobuster `02:00:14`–`02:01:09Z`, back-to-back, both timestamped independently).
- **Nikto findings:** exposed `.bash_history`/`.sh_history`/`.htpasswd`-shaped paths, several `*.json` endpoints ("might be interesting"), a `x-recruiting` header, missing CSP/referrer-policy/HSTS headers — informational web-hygiene findings, not a Suricata-detection test in themselves.
- **Gobuster findings:** real endpoints confirmed — `/api`, `/rest*`, `/assets`, `/media`, `/promotion`, `/ftp`, `/robots.txt`, plus an oddity worth a separate look later (`/Video` and `/video` both returning a 2.2 MB body).
- **Hunt evidence, same source/dest/window, port 3000:** **4,557 total events**, of which **3,637 are real Suricata alerts** (`event.module:"suricata"`), not raw traffic. Distinct signatures: `ET EXPLOIT QNAP Shellshock CVE-2014-6271` (**high**, Attempted Administrator Privilege Gain — nikto's Shellshock-probe header), `GPL WEB_SERVER iisadmin access` (**high**, Web Application Attack), `ET WEB_SERVER WEB-PHP phpinfo access`, `GPL WEB_SERVER global.asa access`, `GPL WEB_SERVER printenv access`, `GPL WEB_SERVER /~root access`, `ET WEB_SERVER Possible Cherokee Web Server GET AUX Request DoS Attempt`, `ET INFO Proxy TRACE Request - inbound`, `ET INFO Dotted Quad Host DLL Request`.
- **Why no §6.1 row is flipped outright:** these signatures are mostly nikto's own vulnerability-probe requests and gobuster's wordlist entries coincidentally matching legacy CGI/PHP/IIS signature paths — real detections, but not a clean match for any existing §6.1 row. The Shellshock signature is the closest (`ET EXPLOIT ...`), but "Known exploit signatures / reverse shells / Metasploit indicators" also explicitly covers reverse-shell/Meterpreter indicators, which are untested here (Tier 2 scope, not yet approved) — flipping that row fully would overclaim based on this evidence alone. Recorded as strong supporting evidence for that row once Tier 2 actually tests exploitation.

**Tier 2 and Tier 3 remain explicitly out of scope without new, separate explicit approval** — this session's authorization covers Tier 1 recon only (full port scan done, Juice Shop web recon done; DC01 AD enumeration next, read-only).

## 7. Troubleshooting history

Real problems from building this lab. Full evidence/commands/rollback steps live in `docs/troubleshooting/0N_*.md` — this is the summary.

| # | Problem | Root cause | Fix / lesson |
|---|---|---|---|
| 7.1 | QEMU guest agent not configured | Not installed/enabled in-guest, channel not configured | Install + enable + configure channel. Lesson: a running VM ≠ working guest integration — test explicitly. |
| 7.2 | virt-manager VM setup | Storage/display quirks | Standardized on qcow2; SPICE issues traced to guest tooling, not hardware. Snapshot before risky changes. |
| 7.3 | OPNsense network debugging | Firewall issues masquerading as app/DNS problems | Verify bottom-up: interface → IP → gateway → DNS → firewall. DNS misconfig was repeatedly the real AD root cause. |
| 7.4 | Security Onion installation | Under-provisioned resources | SOC platforms need materially more RAM/CPU/storage than an ordinary server. A SOC is only as useful as the telemetry reaching it. |
| 7.5 | DC01 AD setup | — | DNS is the foundation AD depends on. Snapshot before promoting to DC (hard to cleanly undo). |
| 7.7 | `soc-mirror.sh` libvirtd deadlock | Synchronous `virsh` callback from inside a libvirt qemu hook could hang libvirtd | Detached the reconciler via `systemd-run --no-block --collect`. |
| 7.8 | libvirt/OPNsense DHCP conflict (2026-07-09) | libvirt's own DHCP collided with OPNsense's; `virbr10` claimed OPNsense's own IP | Stripped libvirt's `<ip>`/`<dhcp>` from the network definition — OPNsense is sole DHCP/DNS/gateway authority. Host got a separate mgmt IP (.254) restored at boot. |

### 7.6 DC01 Fleet health & Sysmon telemetry (2026-07-13)

The largest case — three independent, stacked root causes behind one symptom ("DC01 Offline in Fleet"). Recurring: a 2026-07-10 "fix" was a non-persistent `iptables` rule that any `so-firewall apply`/reboot silently discarded.

1. **Firewall hostgroups** — DC01 was only ever added to `analyst`, never `elastic_agent_endpoint`/`beats_endpoint`/`endgame` (each hostgroup only grants its own ports — see [§5.4](#54-network-ports--firewall-hostgroups-reference)). Fixed with `so-firewall includehost` for all three (additive), `so-firewall apply`.
2. **~9h clock skew** — `vmictimesync` was fighting NTP at every boot (DC01, as PDC Emulator, doesn't behave like an ordinary NTP client). Disabled the service, forced `w32tm /resync`, added a boot-time scheduled task. Side effect: the skew had poisoned Logstash's dead-letter queue with rejected future-timestamped events — explains why `HEALTHY`-reporting agents still showed no data. **Lesson: agent-`HEALTHY` proves shipping, not acceptance.**
3. **Sysmon never installed** — Fleet policy expected `windows.sysmon_operational` data that could never arrive. Installed Sysmon 15.21 + SwiftOnSecurity config.

**Verified:** survives Elastic Agent restart, two DC01 reboots, and a full Security Onion reboot. Rollback procedures (firewall/clock/Sysmon/timezone) kept in `docs/troubleshooting/06_dc01_fleet_health_and_sysmon.md`, not repeated here.

**General lessons:** a "Healthy" status can hide multiple stacked root causes — validate across a real reboot, not just current state. Per-hostgroup firewall reachability doesn't generalize across ports. PDC Emulators aren't ordinary NTP clients.

## 8. Project timeline

| Period | What happened |
|---|---|
| Before 07-05 | Fortress Bazzite: virt-manager, Kali/Debian, Ubuntu Server, Metasploitable2, Docker, Juice Shop, Burp Suite, Metasploit set up. Design doc planning a Suricata+Zeek+Wazuh stack. |
| 07-03 – 07-07 | Kali/Metasploitable2 VMs up, `pentest-lab` network built. Metasploitable2 enumerated and exploited (`vsftpd_234_backdoor` → Meterpreter). Juice Shop deployed, first vuln found via Burp Suite. AX210 WiFi passed through to Kali. Host-level Suricata installed as a side experiment (`/var/home/Joost/FORTRESS/`, separate from this repo). OPNsense installed 07-07 (redone with ZFS after a failed first attempt); WAN/DHCP issues left open. |
| 07-08 | Transition to "SOC Homelab" naming (⚠️ reconstructed from limited evidence). |
| 07-09 | First git commit. Fixed libvirt/OPNsense DHCP conflict ([§7.8](#78-libvirtopnsense-dhcp-conflict-2026-07-09)); Kea DHCP reservations created; launchers fixed for KDE/Konsole. |
| 07-10 | DC01 built (AD DS + DNS, promoted, users created), enrolled in Fleet. First Fleet issue "fixed" non-persistently (see [§7.6](#76-dc01-fleet-health--sysmon-telemetry-2026-07-13)). |
| 07-11 | Full documentation structure created (README, rules, AI policy, network/server/AD docs, troubleshooting history). |
| 07-12 | Secret scrubbed from git history. Desktop launchers rebuilt properly. Traffic mirroring rewritten (deadlock fix). Browser automation for Security Onion built. |
| 07-13 | DC01 Fleet outage fully resolved. Live lab verification pass (IPs, AD structure, hardware). Documentation substantially expanded, including this master document, its AI-rules and attack-scope sections. Commit made, **not pushed** (standing instruction: no push without explicit permission). |

### Active Directory identity inventory

| OU | Accounts |
|---|---|
| `Domain Controllers` | DC01 |
| `Admins` | IT Admin 01 (not in Domain Admins) |
| `AD-Users` | soctest, Helpdesk 01, Employee 01, Manager 01, HR 01, Finance 01 |
| `Service-Accounts` | SQL Service |
| `Workstations` / `Servers` | *(empty)* |

Custom groups: `SOC-Analysts` (soctest), `Helpdesk` (no members). `Domain Admins` = built-in `Administrator` only.

### Software versions

Security Onion 3.1.0 · Elastic Agent 9.3.3+build202604082258 · Sysmon 15.21 (schema 4.91, SwiftOnSecurity config) · Windows Server 2022 Standard Evaluation (DC01).

### Access methods (no passwords stored here)

SSH keys (`~/.ssh/config`) — passwordless for dc01/security-onion/kali/ubuntu-server/win11-01; password-only by design for opnsense. Browser session (Playwright, dedicated profile) for Security Onion/Kibana/Fleet, and a separate one for OPNsense (`browser/launch-opnsense-daemon.mjs`, port 9333). `virsh -c qemu:///system` for VM management.

### Open items

- `opnsense` SSH password-only by design (confirmed via audit, not a regression) — key auth could still be added for convenience if desired.
- OPNsense's own config-revision history is empty (no built-in rollback safety net) and it hasn't checked for firmware updates since install — see `docs/OPNSENSE_AUDIT_2026-07-13.md`.
- The `KALI` firewall alias in OPNsense still points at Kali's old IP (`.157`) — harmless (unused in any active rule) but worth cleaning up.
- ~~`ubuntu-server-01` SSH key login doesn't work~~ — resolved 2026-07-14, key auth confirmed working (user `sysadmin`, not `ubuntu`).
- WiFi PCI-passthrough to Kali not reconfirmed.
- WIN11-01's intended training purpose — see [§12](#12-attack-scope-agreed-red-team-test-plan).

## 10. Glossary

**Active Directory (AD)** — Microsoft's user/computer/permission management system ("domain"). Runs on DC01; domain `pentest.lab`.

**Agent** — a program collecting/forwarding data (logs, metrics) to a central system (see Elastic Agent).

**Beats** — Elastic's lightweight data shippers; run inside Elastic Agent in modern deployments.

**CEST/CET** — Central European (Summer) Time; UTC+1 winter, UTC+2 summer.

**Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)** — where Logstash puts documents it couldn't store in Elasticsearch. A growing counter signals a downstream problem even without a sender-side error.

**Domain Controller (DC)** — AD server managing users/computers. Here: DC01.

**Elastic Agent** — collects Windows Event Logs/Sysmon/metrics on DC01 and ships to Security Onion; multiple components, each with its own health status.

**Elastic Defend** — Elastic Agent's endpoint-security (EDR) component; own Fleet connection (port 3765, hostgroup `endgame`).

**Elasticsearch** — Security Onion's log database; always UTC-internal.

**Firewall hostgroup/portgroup** — [§5.4](#54-network-ports--firewall-hostgroups-reference). Hostgroup = named IP group, portgroup = named port group; Security Onion's firewall links them.

**Fleet / Fleet Server** — Kibana/Elastic's agent-management layer; server side runs on Security Onion, port 8220.

**Hunt** — Security Onion's own search UI (like Kibana Discover).

**KVM/QEMU/libvirt** — this lab's virtualization stack (kernel tech / hardware emulation / management layer).

**NTP** — clock-sync protocol; DC01 uses `pool.ntp.org`.

**PDC Emulator** — AD role: normally the domain's authoritative time source. DC01 holds it (the lab's only DC).

**Security Onion** — this lab's SOC platform (Suricata, Zeek, Elasticsearch, Kibana, Fleet). VM `SOC-SecurityOnion`, .30.

**SIEM** — collects/correlates logs across sources to find incidents. Security Onion is this lab's SIEM.

**Sigma rule** — general-purpose log detection rule format (Suricata's equivalent for network traffic).

**so-firewall** — CLI for Security Onion's own firewall (hostgroup membership). [§5.4](#54-network-ports--firewall-hostgroups-reference).

**Sysmon** — Sysinternals tool logging detailed Windows events far beyond the standard Event Log. On DC01 since 2026-07-13, SwiftOnSecurity config.

**UTC** — global time standard, no offset. Elasticsearch always stores UTC internally.

**vmictimesync** — hypervisor clock-sync service (Hyper-V-compatible, also active under QEMU/KVM). Disabled on DC01 — was overriding NTP at boot.

**Zeek** (formerly Bro) — records network activity (DNS, HTTP, TLS, connections); complements Suricata's attack-pattern focus.

## 11. Current project status / what's next

_Full detail: `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md`._

### ✅ Done

Base infrastructure (all 7 VMs on `pentest-lab`) · event-driven traffic mirroring · AD operational · Security Onion operational (web UI, Kibana, Fleet, Hunt) · DC01 Healthy in Fleet, survives restarts/reboots · passwordless SSH to security-onion/kali/dc01 · four desktop launchers · read-only web-audit script · this documentation structure · live network/asset/AD verification pass (2026-07-13) · read-only OPNsense configuration audit (2026-07-13) · Elastic Agent on the Bazzite host itself, Healthy, confirmed reboot-survival, plus a central health-check script covering it and all 7 lab VMs (2026-07-14) · SSH access to WIN11-01 (2026-07-14) — OpenSSH Server enabled, integrated into `~/.ssh/config` and `lab-ssh-all.sh`/`soc-health-check.sh`, giving it the same admin path as the other lab systems · Elastic Agent + Sysmon on WIN11-01 (2026-07-14) — Healthy in Fleet, Elastic Defend/osquery/winlog/Sysmon/metrics all confirmed, telemetry verified in Hunt; endpoint-monitoring priority 1 of `docs/ROADMAP_ENDPOINT_MONITORING.md` done · Elastic Agent on ubuntu-server-01 (2026-07-14) — Healthy in Fleet, log/metrics-only, telemetry verified in Hunt; priority 2 done · ubuntu-server-01's long-standing `.100`-drift DHCP bug root-caused and fixed (2026-07-14) — see `docs/troubleshooting/12_ubuntu-server-01_dhcp_reservation_fix.md` · endpoint-monitoring phase fully closed (2026-07-15) — Kali will deliberately not get an Elastic Agent, Joost's final decision, not deferred.

### ⚠️ Open

Security Onion OS-level timezone still UTC (cosmetic, blocked on root scope) · AD structural gaps (empty `Helpdesk` group, `IT Admin 01` not elevated, undifferentiated role accounts, empty `Workstations`/`Servers` OUs) — **to be deliberately fixed as part of [§12](#12-attack-scope-agreed-red-team-test-plan)**, not left as-is · the full §12 test pass, AD escalation-path build, and WIN11-01 cleanup are scoped and agreed but **not yet executed** — pre-change snapshots already taken (`DC01`: `2026-07-13-pre-ad-escalation-path`, `WIN11-01`: `2026-07-13-pre-target-cleanup`) · the Bazzite host's own Elastic Agent's log delivery is now verified end-to-end into Elasticsearch (see `docs/troubleshooting/08_bazzite_host_elastic_agent.md`), but not yet re-confirmed across a reboot cycle.

### ❌ Planned

Detection engineering confirmation ([§6.3](#63-detection-validation-plan)) · combined host/security/gaming dashboard · four-tier alerting (INFO/WARNING/HIGH/CRITICAL) with Discord/Telegram forwarding · VLAN segmentation, separate mgmt/attack networks, additional Windows clients, honeypots, periodic Purple Team exercises.

### Keeping this current

Every important change: update the specific source doc → `CHANGELOG.md` → `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md` → a daily report in `docs/daily/` → this master document.

## 12. Attack scope: agreed Red Team test plan

**Scope agreed with Joost 2026-07-13; execution deliberately deferred to a dedicated session.** Grounded in the live-verified lab state above — nothing generic. Everything stays inside `192.168.50.0/24`, launched from Kali, against only the lab's own systems.

**Agreed order:**

1. **Tier 1 + 2 together, first** — recon/enumeration plus exploitation of the intentionally-vulnerable targets (Metasploitable2, Juice Shop). Low risk, closes most of [§6.1](#61-what-this-soc-should-detect)'s ⚠️ rows.
2. **AD attack chain (Tier 3) — build the escalation path first.** The environment currently has none (`IT Admin 01` isn't a Domain Admin). Before Kerberoasting/privilege-escalation practice: set an SPN on `SQL Service`, give `IT Admin 01` real elevated rights. This is an infrastructure change — full change procedure ([§4](#4-architecture-security--ai-rules)), its own explained/confirmed step, not bundled into the attack.
3. **WIN11-01 becomes a target too, after cleanup** — move `DESKTOP-EFKB8GQ` into `OU=Workstations`, general tidy-up, *then* deliberately loosen its firewall for lateral-movement testing (WIN11-01 → DC01).

**Preparation already done:** pre-change snapshots (`DC01`: `2026-07-13-pre-ad-escalation-path`, `WIN11-01`: `2026-07-13-pre-target-cleanup`). One `nmap -sn` sweep run (confirmed known IPs only); a Metasploitable2 full-port scan was started and deliberately stopped at Joost's request. **No exploitation, AD changes, or firewall changes executed yet.**

### Tier 1 — Reconnaissance & enumeration

| Scenario | Target | Technique |
|---|---|---|
| Full port/service scan | Metasploitable2 (.70) | `nmap -sV -sC -p-` |
| Web app recon | Juice Shop (.40:3000) | `nikto`, `gobuster`/`ffuf` |
| AD/domain enumeration | DC01 (.10) | `enum4linux-ng`, `netexec smb`, anonymous LDAP |
| Network sweep | `.0/24` | `nmap -sn` |

### Tier 2 — Exploitation of intentionally-vulnerable targets

| Scenario | Target | Technique |
|---|---|---|
| vsftpd backdoor | Metasploitable2:21 | `vsftpd_234_backdoor` (repeats the historical exploit, [§8](#8-project-timeline)) |
| Samba/NFS/RMI | Metasploitable2 | `usermap_script`, anonymous NFS mount, Java-RMI deserialization |
| OWASP Top 10 | Juice Shop | SQLi, broken auth, IDOR, XSS — built-in scored challenges |
| UnrealIRCd backdoor | Metasploitable2:6667 | Known backdoor trigger |

### Tier 3 — Active Directory attack chain (after the escalation-path build)

| Scenario | Target | Technique |
|---|---|---|
| Password spraying | DC01 | Common passwords, low attempts/account |
| Kerberoasting | DC01 | TGS request for `SQL Service`, crack offline (needs the SPN) |
| AS-REP roasting | DC01 | Needs an account with Kerberos pre-auth disabled (none exists yet) |
| Lateral movement | WIN11-01 → DC01 | From an assumed foothold — worth testing against the current locked-down firewall first |
| Golden/Silver ticket | DC01 | Capstone — needs prior privileged access |

**Execution checklist:** Tier 1+2 → cross-check Hunt, flip [§6.1](#61-what-this-soc-should-detect) statuses → build the AD escalation path (explained/confirmed) → clean up WIN11-01, loosen its firewall → run Tier 3 + lateral movement → update §6.1/§11 with results.
